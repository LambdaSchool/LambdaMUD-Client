Okay so here we are again...

so what do we need...

* a login screen

* a create account screen

* a game screen

* probably a home screen

* let's start there first

* so I can successfully register and login, so that's a huge leap for me

* I still have so much more to do, so let's get started...

* I haven't touched WebSockets yet...

* so now I need to think in which direction to move next...you see that's my problem...
* As I've done all my life, I'll often try to think in sixteen directions at once...
* this never works out well for me, of course. 
* I'm avoiding that right now...
* So let's see, I've got a two working components, Login and Register, but at the moment 
* my views look atrocious and I have to manually plop either the Login or the Register component
* into the root <div> of the App.js file. I need this to work dynamically, of course, so I'm going to 
* start with that today.

* What do I want to happen? Perhaps listing it here before moving on will help me build the rest of it out, 
* one piece at a time...

1. Home page welcomes user to the Super Adventure Game and has options for signing up or logging in.
2. Upon logging in, the user is redirected to the main game screen, where the game starts.
3. Upon registering, what do I want to happen? I'm pretty sure I want to also log them in immediately...
